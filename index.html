            <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet of our Solar System, known for its extreme temperatures, rocky, cratered surface, and a large iron core. Named after the Roman messenger god due to its swift orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, it is a terrestrial planet with a thin exosphere and ice at its poles. Its surface is characterized by craters and cliffs formed as the planet shrunk over billions of years. </p>

            <p>Venus, named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty, is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It is a scorching, rocky "sister planet" to Earth due to similar size and mass but with a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere that creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus also has a unique retrograde (backward) rotation and a brilliant yellowish-white appearance due to its sulfuric acid clouds. </p>

            <p>Earth is the planet we live on, the third planet from the Sun, and the only known place in the universe to support life due to its liquid water, atmosphere, and magnetic field. It formed about 4.5 billion years ago and has a dynamic surface of land and oceans, divided into tectonic plates, with continuous processes like earthquakes and volcanoes shaping it. Its atmosphere protects it from space, and its rotation creates day and night, while its orbit around the Sun creates years. </p>

            <p>Mars, often called the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun, known for its rusty, iron-rich surface and a thin atmosphere. It is a cold, desert world with seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons, and powerful winds that can create planet-engulfing dust storms. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and is a key target for scientific exploration due to evidence of past water and the potential for life.</p>

            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and features a prominent storm known as the Great Red Spot, which has been ongoing for centuries. Jupiter is characterized by its swirling bands of clouds, an extensive system of moons, including the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), and a powerful magnetic field. It was named after the king of the Roman gods and is one of the brightest objects in Earth's night sky.</p>

            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, a gas giant known for its spectacular, prominent ring system. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, it is the least dense planet, capable of floating on water. Saturn is also a system of moons, including Titan, the only moon with a dense atmosphere, making it a "solar system unto itself".</p>

            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and a blue-green ice giant known for its extreme 90-degree axial tilt, which causes it to spin on its side. Composed primarily of "water, methane, and ammonia," it has a rocky core and a thick, turbulent atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Its distinct color comes from the methane gas in its atmosphere, and it features faint rings, 28 known moons, and features violent winds and extreme seasons due to its unique tilt. </p>

            <p>Neptune is the eighth and outermost planet in our solar system, an ice giant characterized by its deep blue color and powerful winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a storm the size of Earth. It is the fourth-largest planet, with a rocky core surrounded by a slushy mix of water, ammonia, and methane. Neptune has at least 16 moons and is named after the Roman god of the sea.</p>

            <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, it was initially considered the ninth planet but was reclassified in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) due to new criteria for a planet, which Pluto does not meet. It is a small, icy world with five known moons, the largest being Charon. </p>

            <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, a rocky, spherical body that orbits our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 km (238,854 mi). It orbits the Earth in about 27.3 days and is tidally locked, always showing the same face. The Moon's gravitational pull is the primary driver of Earth's tides, and its surface is marked by craters from impacts with asteroids and comets.</p>
